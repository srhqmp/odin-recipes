        <li>3 cloves garlic, smashed</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons white sugar</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon fish sauce (Optional)</li>

        <li>1 pound beef steak, sliced 1/4 inch thick</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons vegetable oil, divided, or as needed</li>
        <li>4 potatoes, cut into wedges (Optional)</li>
        <li>1 large onion, cut into rings</li>
        <li>1/8 cup water (Optional)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Combine soy sauce, calamansi juice, garlic, sugar, fish sauce, and pepper in a bowl.
            Taste and adjust to your liking. Add sliced beef, making sure it is coated evenly.
            Marinate for at least 30 minutes or up to 1 hour.
        </li>
        <li>Heat 1 tablespoon oil in a wok or pan over medium-high heat. Fry potatoes in the 
            hot oil until the edges turn golden brown. 7 to 10 minutes. Transfer to a plate.
        </li>
        <li>Heat remaining oil in the same pan over medium-high heat and fry onions until edges turn brown, 7 to 10 minutes. 
            Transfer to the same plate.
        </li>
        <li>Heat the same pan over medium-high heat. 
            Reserve marinade and fry beef in batches, adding more vegetable oil if necessary, 
            until browned and no longer pink in the centers, 5 to 7 minutes. 
            Transfer to the plate and continue with remaining beef.
        </li>
        <li>Pour reserved marinade into the pan with water to deglaze, 
            scraping up browned bits from the bottom of the pan using a wooden spoon. 
            Taste and adjust seasonings. Return beef back to the pan with some onion, 
            leaving remaining onion for garnish; reduce heat and let simmer until sauce has thickened, 
            7 to 10 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>Slide beef and sauce onto a serving plate. 
            Garnish with remaining onion. Place potatoes on the side and serve.
        </li>
    </ol>
