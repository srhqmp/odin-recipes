    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Sinangag is a Filipino fried rice dish cooked by stir-frying pre-cooked rice with garlic.
         The rice used is preferably stale, usually leftover cooked rice from the previous day,
          as it results in rice that is slightly fermented and firmer. It is garnished with 
          toasted garlic, rock salt, black pepper and sometimes chopped scallions. The rice 
          grains are ideally loose and not stuck together.
    </p>
    <p>It is a common part of a traditional Filipino breakfast and it usually prepared 
        with leftover rice from the dinner before.
